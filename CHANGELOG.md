# Changelog

All notable changes to FishIntel / AquaIntel. Format follows the spirit of
Keep a Changelog; versions come from `core/version.py` (single source of truth).

## [Unreleased] — Session 40 (2026-10-12)

### Added
- `core/version.py` — single version source (PLATFORM_VERSION, API_SCHEMA_VERSION);
  provenance envelopes now carry `schema_version` (arch report §7.2).
- CI enabled for real: all 3 GitHub workflows now trigger on `master` (they had
  never run — trigger was main-only on a master repo). First runs surfaced and
  fixed: impossible pip resolution (uni2ts vs scipy), missing `greenlet`
  (`sqlalchemy[asyncio]`), uppercase GHCR tag.
- `requirements-models.txt` — heavy foundation-model stack split out of
  `requirements.txt` (~2 GB lighter default install and Docker image).
- Router decomposition: `misc_routes.py` → `feed_cost_routes`, `ocean_routes`,
  `macro_routes`, `causal_routes`, `ras_routes` (57 routes preserved verbatim,
  mechanically verified old ≡ new); 16 structural tests.
- `response_model` wave 1 (4 new exact schemas; typed routes 8 → 12) +
  `TYPED_ROUTE_FLOOR` CI ratchet test.
- `core/pagination.py` (PageParams/paginate) + all 11 unbounded `limit` params
  Query-bounded (le ≤ 1000 / 10000 / 50000 where justified).
- `scripts/firecrawl_research.py` research helper; `docs/MCP_SETUP.md`;
  project `.mcp.json`; 4 new project skills (engine-audit, release,
  satellite-research, visual-regression); ecosystem skills installed.
- Research: `docs/summit/REPORT_SATELLITE.md` (verified quotas + cost path),
  `REPORT_STACK.md` (2026 versions), `docs/raw/` source captures.

### Fixed
- Missing-await bug class burn-down: biomass outlook/scenarios (+ scenario
  cache-key collision), GNN training data, LLM farm-network tool, federated
  benchmark (endpoints were fully dead), pairs engine overlay chain, ESG getters,
  morning brief (sync Session + wrong method + Bloom section), resistance tracker.
- Admin exports now stream (CSV/JSON generators) — 186k-row export no longer
  materializes ~13 MB in memory; audit logs `streamed=true`.
- `/api/lice/summary` TTL-cached: 70 ms → 2 ms warm (35×) on the 186k-row aggregate.
- API keys: malformed keys fail fast before DB/bcrypt; `last_used` write
  throttled to 60 s.
- Chat agent conversation history bounded (200 entries).
- Migrations run once in `scripts/docker-entrypoint.sh` before gunicorn workers
  (`FISHINTEL_RUN_MIGRATIONS=0`); `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` documents the flow.
- Docker entrypoint LF-normalized; `.gitattributes` already enforces this.

### Changed
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` stats refreshed; version literals centralized.

## [2.2.0] — pre-Session-40 baseline
- 324 routes, 30 routers, 605+ tests baseline with prior sessions' hardening
  (error envelope, bounded caches, SSB/MET resilience, WS single-producer).
